# `@radutils` Config Builder

```
npm install @radutils/config-builder
```

`@radutils` Config Builder provides a type-safe way of compiling configuration options for your application. It separates the configuration definition from the source or sources allowing you to construct configuration objects declaratively and separated from where values come from and how they are retrieved. It also enables you to construct configuration objects for multiple scenarios based on the same sources.
